The code will define an array (JSON data) which will hold the content that will be cycled through. 

    It will also define a variable that will keep track of the current index in the array, and a displayElement variable which refers to the HTML element that will display the content.

An event listener is added to the displayElement that listens for clicks 
    When the element is clicked, the variable is incremented, wrapping around to 0 (when needed)

The display element is then updated with the new content using the innerHTML property.


At the botton, the user will be able to cycle through certain categories. Using if statements, images will be yielded. 

<!-- "This 'vehicle', in 'location', is in 'color'; with this 'line' written on it" -->

if "vehicle=truck"
    display 
        'image 1, image 5, image 6"
